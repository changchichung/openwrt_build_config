### openwrt_build_config

all these config files can build with https://github.com/project-openwrt/openwrt

But this project was maintained by China developers

so the repo always contain various apps for china , like unblockneteasemusic and etc...

it's useless for people who lived in freedom country , like Taiwan !!

there are so many powerful routers in China's market

I try to customize these routers with openwrt and test for some purpose , like wesher

https://github.com/costela/wesher

so I modify the config , remove china langs and apps for china , install python/wireguard for my environment.
